	- Veusz now tracks default settings in ~/.veusz.def file for each
	user
	- It is possible to copy settings from one widget to another using
	a menu
	- The bullseye symbol works correctly now
	- Reading data now gives the count of conversion errors rather
	than throwing an exception (in the import dialog)
	- ImportFile and ImportString now also return the number of
	conversion errors during reading (as part of a tuple)
	- Added ChangeLog file
	- Fixed problems where Veusz doesn't update plot window due to Qt
	clipping
	- Fitting widget now stores chi2, dof, reduced chi2 setting
	(readonly). This allows	scripts to query these values.
