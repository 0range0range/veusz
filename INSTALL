Veusz Installation
==================

Veusz now uses distutils for its installation. We actually provide a
version of distutils with the distribution (see setuptools). This is
to allow users of Python < 2.4 to allow installation.

Requirements:
 python 2.3      http://www.python.org/
 PyQt            http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/
 Numarray        http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray


(PyQt requres
 QT              http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/
 SIP             http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/   )

Simple use
==========
If you don't want to bother installing veusz fully, it can be run from
its own directory. Simply do:

# cd veusz-0.5
#./veusz.py

Proper installation
===================
There are a number of ways to install programs using distutils. I will
list a few of the possible method here:

==> To make an rpm from the distribution
# cd veusz-0.5
# python setup.py bdist_rpm

An rpm should be generated in the dist subdirectory
