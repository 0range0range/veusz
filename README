Veusz is Copyright (C) 2003 Jeremy S. Sanders <jeremy@jeremysanders.net>

Veusz is a scientific plotting package written in Python. It uses PyQt
for display and user-interfaces, and Numarray for handling the numeric
data. Veusz is licenced under the GPL. Please read the file COPYING
included in this distribution for information about the licence.

This is a very preliminary version of the program. It demonstrates
some of the features but has no human-usable interface as yet.

The idea is to have a program which can generate publication-ready
plots in Postscript, be easily scriptable, and easily extended.

Ideally, features to be included are:
 o Plotting
 o Fitting data
 o Contour plots
 o Image data
...

Please see the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
