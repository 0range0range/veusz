Veusz is a Qt4 based scientific plotting package. It is written in
Python, using PyQt4 for display and user-interfaces, and numpy for
handling the numeric data. Veusz is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript/PDF/SVG output. The user interface aims
to be simple, consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides a GUI, command line, embedding and scripting interface
(based on Python) to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.16:
 * Experimental MathML support
 * Support for *args and **kwargs for custom functions
 * Add upper/lower-left/right arrows
 * Add options to clip text/lines/shapes to graphs
 * Add stacked-area option to bar plot widget
 * Draw stacked bar plots top-down for better overlapping line behaviour

Bug fixes:
 * Workaround for splash screen problem
 * Fix numerous problems reported by pyflakes
 * Histograms fail when saved
 * Fix plot with nan functions
 * Fix failure of self tests on ARM platforms

Features of package:
 * X-Y plots (with errorbars)
 * Line and function plots
 * Contour plots
 * Images (with colour mappings and colorbars)
 * Stepped plots (for histograms)
 * Bar graphs
 * Vector field plots
 * Box plots
 * Polar plots
 * Ternary plots
 * Plotting dates
 * Fitting functions to data
 * Stacked plots and arrays of plots
 * Plot keys
 * Plot labels
 * Shapes and arrows on plots
 * LaTeX-like formatting for text
 * EPS/PDF/PNG/SVG/EMF export
 * Scripting interface
 * Dataset creation/manipulation
 * Embed Veusz within other programs
 * Text, CSV, FITS, NPY/NPZ, QDP, binary and user-plugin importing
 * Data can be captured from external sources
 * User defined functions, constants and can import external Python functions
 * Plugin interface to allow user to write or load code to
    - import data using new formats
    - make new datasets, optionally linked to existing datasets
    - arbitrarily manipulate the document
 * Data picker
 * Interactive tutorial
 * Multithreaded rendering

For documentation on using Veusz, see the "Documents" directory. The
manual is in PDF, HTML and text format (generated from docbook). The
examples are also useful documentation. Please also see and contribute

Issues with the current version:

 * Some recent versions of PyQt/SIP will causes crashes when exporting
   SVG files. Update to 4.7.4 (if released) or a recent snapshot to
   solve this problem.
